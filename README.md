#ASmith Project 1 - *Wordle APP*

Here's my week 1 project I built utilizing my swift Skills
Submitted by: **Asantwa Smith**

**Wordle** is an app that allows you to ssubmit five letters to guess a word. [TODO] 

Time spent: **72** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] App displays a keyboard on the screen
- [X] When tapping on the keyboard, a letter is shown or deleted (letter selected)
- [X] User can play a basic version of Wordle, with different goal words each time

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Improve and customize the user interface by adding a launchscreen and app icon
- [ ] Run the app on a device rather than in the simulator

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
In the future I'd like to add a sstartup screen.
